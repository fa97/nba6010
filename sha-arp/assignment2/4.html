            <h4>4a. Read the article on Direct Marketing and explain how Target determines if someone is pregnant.</h4>
            <p>
               Target assigns every customer a id number and other details that become a bucket that stores a history of 
                everything the customer has bought and any demographic information. Using that, it looks up and analyses 
                at historical buying data for all the ladies who had signed up for Target baby registries in the past. 
                It recognizes useful patterns like buying baby unscented lotions, supplements lie calcium, magnesium, zinc 
                and assigns pregnancy score and thus predicts if someone is pregnant.

            <h4>4b. What is relationship marketing? How is it different from direct marketing?</h4>
           
            <p>
               Direct marketers try to predict by behavior profiling like tracking an individual's purchases through shopping 
                cards can forecast an individual's future purchases. Relationship marketing is to track the customers over time 
                and adjust to their changing needs. This is different from direct marketing in the sense that this tracks the 
                customer through the whole process of buying and builds a profile to make suggestions or otherwise and not just 
                keeping track of final purchases.

            <h4>4c. Why is relationship marketing more desirable than mass marketing? Why was mass marketing more desirable in the past? What changed?</h4>
            <p>
               Mass marketing is general advertising to a wide non-segmented group of consumers, 
                such as TV, Radio. The advertiser uses one message for the entire audience, hoping it is general enough to 
                appeal to a lot of them.  In the past, products were standardized and the communication costs made mass marketing 
                desirable. But in recent times due to lots of competition and supply, technology advancement enabling larger
                 audience reach. Customers are increasing convenience shopping rather than price driven and hence the need for 
                better services and customer engagement is necessary for increasing customer base through relationship management.
