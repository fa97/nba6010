            <h4>3a. Add a second table to your database. Make sure it is also non-redundant. 
                Describe the new table on your a2 page by using the notation of Question 1, and also in English</h4>
            <p>
                Order(order_number, product_name, email)
            </p>
            <p>
                Our table consists of 3 columns to capture the order details.
                <ol>
                    <li>order_number stores the unique number for this orders</li>
                    <li>product name stores the name of the product for this order. We allow only one product per order.</li>
                    <li>email field references the email field of the customer. This field is
                        used to create a link between the customer table and order table.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h4>3b. Write a two-table query. Save it in your database. Describe the new query on your a2 page by   
      writing it in SQL, and also in English.</h4>
            <p>
                We created the following query:
            </p>
            <p>
                SELECT Customer.*, Order.Order_number, Order.Product_name
                FROM Customer INNER JOIN [Order] ON Customer.email = Order.email where product_name='Apples';

            </p>
            <p>
                The above query displays the customer details along with one of the customer order detail where the product that was
                ordered is "Apples". We link the two tables based on the email address field and ask the query to fetch all fields of
                customer table and the order_number and product name field of order table.
            </p>
            </div>
        </div>      . 
    </div>
