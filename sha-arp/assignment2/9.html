            <h4>9a. Explain the fundamental tradeoff between inconsistency and information overload in organizational    
                decision-making. How is it related to the centralization-decentralization debate?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Decentralization of information is a situation where information is held with individual or at the edges 
                of the organization. And centralization is a scenario where information is held at the center of the organization
                 and not distributed across. Inconsistency in information can make the business fail when the businesses make 
                decision about something that they do not own. The individual business within organization may compete against
                 each other. Information overload leads to a situation where an organization is overloaded with local decisions.
                 This could also make the business fail. Centralization or decentralization can cause too much information or 
                inconsistent information. Thus inconsistency information overload is related to decentralization and 
                centralization.

            <h4>9b. Do network effects tip the balance towards centralization or decentralization, according to Braess’     
       Paradox?</h4>
           
            <p>
               Yes, according to Braess network effects do tip the balance and complicate the centralization-decentralization 
                issue further. He says that network effects require more centralization to reach global optimum. He suggests that
                 decision involving resources  with network effects needs to be centralized, as new technologies with better 
                performance may lead to worse outcome.

            <h4>9c. Braess uses highways to demonstrate his paradox. Do highways have network effects? What kind?</h4>
            <p>
               Yes, highways do exhibit network effects. Say new faster route is added, then the driver will take the route 
                that is most favorable to him. This may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual 
                running times.

            <h4>9d. Braess argues that wide spread adoption of new and improved technologies may leave everyone     
       worse off. List the conditions that would lead to that outcome. Give an example from your business     
       or military weapons technologies.</h4>
            <p>
               New and Improved technologies can result in everyone being worse off than before. The conditions that lead to 
                such a situation are as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Addition of extra capacity to the network</li>
                    <li>moving entities selfishly choose their route</li>
                    <li>no centralized control over the choices by the moving entities</li>
                </ol>
              
            </p>
            <p>
                In military weapons technologies, invention of a new and advanced weapon by one country leads and forces
                other countries to follow suit. No country wants to be left behind in the arms race. Every country selfishly
                chooses to develop or purchase the new weapon since everybody else has it. This cycle of continues with 
                everyone spending a lot of money to get what eveybody else has. Thus, this results in everyone being worse off 
                in spite of the invention of the new technology.
