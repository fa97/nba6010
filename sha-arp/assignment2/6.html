            <h4>6a. Explain how online stores can exploit the services provided by physical stores? How can physical stores respond?</h4>
            <p>
                Online stores hold less inventory and deliver better information to its customers. They can maintain the
                 database of inventory of physical retail store and hence makes business by distributing information in a bette
                r way. Physical stores can respond positively by allowing interaction of their product. It simplifies their 
                business marketing by not having to deliver products, but provide with repair  or returns. The combination of both
                leads to optimal solution.

            <h4>6b .Read the article titled “Google vs Amazon” and explain how Google intends to take advantage of the 
                existing physical stores to create an online store?</h4>
           
            <p>
               Google working on the idea of delivery services through which people can buy from local retailer/branches
                 after a search and get it delivered through Google delivery and pay through Google Wallet online or offline. 
                Google also promises to refund/ replace the purchase if the customer is dissatisfied. Google does not intend to 
                build stores or warehouses but makes money through add deals for local retailers and selling its own offers, hence
                 taking advantage of existing physical stores.
