            <h4>2a. For one of your competitors, write a brief description of their business as contrasted to yours</h4>
            <p>
                One of our major competitors is Rosie App. Rosie is an on-line shopping store, enabling its customers to 
                shop for groceries from a variety of local stores. Rosie offers its customers in-store pickup and door delivery.
                It charges a convenience fee for each order and requires that the order be of a minimum amount before checkout.
            </p>
            <p>
                CMart is different from Rosie in a number of ways, shown below:  
            </p>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Social and Health Features</td>

                        read review by other CMart customers. It also advises on dietary requirements.
                        Customers can track their usage, spends and nutritional information of their orders. CMart encourages healthy

            <h4>2b. describe what your competitive advantage might be</h4>
            <p>
                The following are CMart's competitive advantages:
                <ol>
                    <li>CMart is the most cost-effective solution available in the market. It enables its cusomters to 
                        see a variety of deals from multiple partners and choose the lowest price with the best quality.</li>
                    <li>CMart is proudly mobile first. At CMart, we have realised that the future lies in mobile devices.
                        CMart launched with an ios app for apple devices and has a strong focus on developing the platform with
                        a mobile first approach. We want to enable our customers to order grocery from anywhere and everywhere
                        with an intuitive interface they will love.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CMart has a strong social focus too. Customers are much more willing to buy a product if their friends
                        recommend it. Also, knowing about how other users found a product helps customers make the right choice
                        while shopping.
