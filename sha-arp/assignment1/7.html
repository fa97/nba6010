            <h4>7a. What are (positive) Network Effects? Give an example of a product with network effects, and explain.</h4>
            <p>
                A positive network effect is an effect or phenomena such that the value of the product to a user increases with
                 the total number of its users. The value of technology is a quadratic function to the number of its users.
            </p>
            <p>
            One classic example of network effect is fax machine. It was invented in 1843 but it did not gain wide spread usage 
                as it is useful only when there are many people using it. In 1910  newspapers started using it for commercial 
                purposes. The more people owing a fax machine, the more valuable the fax machine is to its users. It gained wide 
                scale adoption in 1980-1990. In this example we can also see a delay in adoption due the network effects.

            <h4>7b .Are there network effects in any product in your business? If yes, explain why and what your strategy is to 
                use those network effects to your advantage. If not, explain if fashion and reputation can lead to network effects
                 in your products.</h4>
            <p>
              Yes. We do have network effect in our business. People do believe things merely because many other people do.
                With the enhanced user experience, timely and efficient delivery of the products, customized top class service, people will soon get hooked on to using this.
            </p>
            <p>
               Our strategy is to reduce the cost to our customers by tie up with local farms. As we attract more customers,
                 we create a bandwagon effect where in many more hop on to using our product. This would then generate more 
                demands which would in turn lead to quality products to our customers through many tie-ups which also benefit 
                the local farms. While we start benefiting from the network effects, we would introduce some convenience and 
                other offers to retain our clients and increase the profit gain.

            <h4>7c. Read the article on Network Effects on the Web, and explain the economic problems caused by Network effects. Give an example from the article.</h4>
            <p>
              The internet had to be the model of free market with competition in every sector. But network effect on  the web is such that, the product becomes more valuable to each user as the number of users rises and creates large information monopolies as it leads to dominance of the product. This monopoly leads to economic problems by not letting new entrants who would bring in lower prices and innovative technologies which leads to a world with fewer options. Additionally, these monopolies do not give up after their term rather do everything possible to stay in power. These over the long run stagnate the economy which once were a highly dynamic parts.

                An example of this is AT&T which had near absolute dominion over the telephone from 1914-1984. It suppressed its own invention of magnetic recording for  the fear that it would deter use of the telephone hence a threat to their monopoly.
