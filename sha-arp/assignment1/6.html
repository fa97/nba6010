            <h4>6a. Explain how online education can be a disruptive technology in education industry. What are the advantages of online education? What are the disadvantages?</h4>
            <p>
                Online education has offered doors to higher education to students who lack access to elite universities. It has even lead to high paying jobs and sophisticated skills 
                without tuition or a college degree. Some of these courses also come with informal credential of course completion. All these accounts as a threat to traditional education and hence proves to be  disruptive technology in education industry.
                Availability, access, low cost, benefits as explained above along with encouragement to understand the subject matter and gain higher grades, social interaction through discussion boards are some of the advantages of online education.
                Some of the disadvantages could be - it might lead to issues in copyrights, giving away official credentials of courses, students need to be highly motivated to complete  the course

            <h4>6b .Explain why disruptive technologies are often low quality initially. Why is low quality an advantage? How do they overcome the quality issue?</h4>
           
            <p>
               Disruptive technologies are often low quality to keep the product simple and cost of the product at a much lower
               price than its superior counterpart. This is an advantage as for many consumer  simple product with lower price is 
               an obvious choice than a complex expensive product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the time these product improves on its quality by the virtue that product improve more rapidly than consumer
                needs,  and hence sooner performance becomes good enough . Adding additional complexity to increase performance is
                actively harmful to customer’s user experience.  Disruptive technology  strikes a right balance with simplicity and 
                performance.
